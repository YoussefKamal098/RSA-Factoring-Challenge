# RSA Factoring

1. **RSA**:
   - Description: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data transmission over networks. It relies on the mathematical properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic for encryption and decryption.
   - Purpose: To provide a brief overview of the RSA encryption algorithm.
   - Example Usage: "RSA is a widely-used public-key encryption algorithm that forms the basis of secure data transmission over networks."

2. **How does HTTPS provide security?**:
   - Description: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol for secure communication over a computer network, most notably the internet. It combines the HTTP protocol with SSL/TLS encryption to ensure secure data transmission.
   - Purpose: To explain the security mechanisms employed by HTTPS to protect data transmission.
   - Example Usage: "HTTPS provides security through the use of SSL/TLS encryption, which encrypts data transmitted between the client and server, preventing unauthorized access or interception of sensitive information."

3. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Description: Prime factorization is the process of finding the prime numbers that multiply together to give a particular composite number. It is a fundamental concept in number theory and plays a crucial role in cryptography, particularly in the RSA encryption algorithm.
   - Purpose: To describe the concept of prime factorization and its significance in cryptography.
   - Example Usage: "Prime factorization is the process of decomposing a composite number into its prime factors. In RSA encryption, prime factorization forms the basis of the security mechanism by making it computationally infeasible to factorize large semiprime numbers."

4. **Why RSA?**:
   - Description: RSA is chosen for its security, efficiency, and versatility in providing public-key encryption and digital signatures.
   - Purpose: To discuss the reasons behind the widespread adoption of the RSA encryption algorithm.
   - Example Usage: "RSA is preferred for its strong security guarantees, efficient implementation, and suitability for various cryptographic applications, including secure communication, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols."
